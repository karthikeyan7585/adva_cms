# The Plugin::Migrator class contains the logic to run migrations from
# within plugin directories. The directory in which a plugin's migrations
# should be is determined by the Plugin#migration_directory method.
#
# To migrate a plugin, you can simple call the migrate method (Plugin#migrate)
# with the version number that plugin should be at. The plugin's migrations
# will then be used to migrate up (or down) to the given version.
#
# For more information, see Engines::RailsExtensions::Migrations

    # to the existing version causes all migrations to be run where that
    # migration number doesn't exist (i.e. zero). We could fix this by
    # removing the line if the version hits zero...?
