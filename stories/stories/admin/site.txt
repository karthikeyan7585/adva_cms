Story: Managing sites
  As an admin
  I want to manage my sites
  So I can add, update and delete sites
  
  Scenario: An admin creates a new site
    Given a site
    And the user is logged in as superuser
    When the user visits the admin sites list page
    When the user clicks on 'New'
    Then the page has an admin site creation form
    When the user fills in the admin site creation form with valid values
    And the user clicks the 'Create' button
    Then a new Site is created
    And the user is redirected the admin site show page

  Scenario: An admin updates a site's settings
    Given a site
    And the user is logged in as admin
    When the user visits the admin site edit page
    Then the page has an admin site edit form
    When the user fills in website title with 'an updated title'
    And the user clicks the 'Save' button
    Then the site's title is set to 'an updated title'
    And the user is redirected the admin site edit page
