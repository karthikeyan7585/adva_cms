  As a user
  I can install the initial site from a web form
  So I can get going quickly
  
  Scenario: A user installs the intial site
    Given no site exists
    And no user exists
    When the user goes to the url /
    Then the user sees the install page
    And the page has a site install form
    When the user fills in the site install form with valid values
    And the user clicks the 'Create' button
    Then a new Site is created
    And the root section is saved
    And an admin account is created
    And the admin account is verified
    And the system authenticates the user as superuser
    
Story: Viewing an empty frontend after installation
  As a user
  I want to access the frontend after installation without doing anything else
  So I can leave the admin interface early
  
  Scenario:
    Given no site exists
    And no user exists
    When the user goes to the url /
    When the user fills in the site install form with valid values
    And the user clicks the 'Create' button
    When the user clicks on 'logout'
    Then the user sees an empty homepage
