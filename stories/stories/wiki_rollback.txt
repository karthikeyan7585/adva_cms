Story: Rolling back a wikipage to a previous revision 
  As a user with a given role that allows me to update wikipages
  I want to rollback a wikipage to a previous revision
  So the wikipage has the old content
  
  Scenario: An anonymous user rolls back a wikipage
    Given page cache is enabled and empty
    And a wiki that allows anonymous users to create and update wikipages
    And a wikipage that has a revision
    When the user visits the wikipage page
    Then the page shows 'the wikipage body'
    And the page is cached
    When the user clicks on 'previous revision'
    # When the user visits the wikipage revision page
    And the user clicks on 'rollback to this revision'
    Then a new version of the wikipage is created
    And the wikipage's body is set to 'the old wikipage body'
    And the page shows 'the old wikipage body'
    And the page is cached
