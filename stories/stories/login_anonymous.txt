Story: Anonymous login
  As an anonymous user
  I can post my name, email and homepage
  So the system remembers me as an anonymous user
  
  Scenario: After submitting a comment as an anonymous the user is recognized by the system
    Given no anonymous account exists
    And a blog that allows anonymous users to create comments
    And a published blog article
    When the user posts a comment to the blog article
    Then an anonymous account exists
    When the user goes to the comment show page
    Then the system authenticates the user as a known anonymous
    And the anonymous id is saved to a cookie
